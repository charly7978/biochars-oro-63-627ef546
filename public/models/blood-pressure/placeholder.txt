This directory is reserved for TensorFlow.js blood pressure estimation models.

Your model files (.json and .bin shards) should be placed here.
For example:
- model.json (main model description)
- group1-shard1of1.bin (weights)

The model path in the BloodPressureModel.ts file should point to:
'/models/blood-pressure/model.json'

*** IMPORTANT ***
Real model files must be provided separately.
This is just a placeholder so the directory structure is preserved in Git.
