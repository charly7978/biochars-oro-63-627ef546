This directory is reserved for TensorFlow.js models.

Your model files (.json and .bin shards) should be placed here.
For example:
- model.json (main model description)
- group1-shard1of1.bin (weights)

The model path in the HeartRateModel.ts file should point to:
'/models/heart-rate/model.json'

*** IMPORTANT ***
Real model files must be provided separately. 
This is just a placeholder so the directory structure is preserved in Git.

To create your own models, you can use TensorFlow/Keras and convert them using the 
TensorFlow.js Converter: https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_keras
